							<p>I work on machine learning applications and research at NASA Langley Research Center. At NASA, I have had the unique opportunity to collaborate with many brilliant engineers and scientists to solve a variety of scientific and engineering problems with machine learning.

							<h2>Projects @ NASA</h2>
							<h3>Automated Analysis of Nondestructive Evaluation Data</h3>
							<p>Nondestructive evaluations (NDE) involves using methods to investigate the internal properties of materials without causing changes to the material. For example, just as a doctor can use x-ray to determine if a patient has a broken bone, engineers can use methods such as x-ray computed tomography to determine if materials such as carbon fiber have internal defects. Analyazing the data generated by these methods can be tedious and requires significant expertise. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop methods that are able to automate some of this analysis process.</p>
							<p>So far, this work has foused specifically on the problem of segmentating defects known as delaminations from carbon fiber CT data. CT data is often best visualized as stacks of 2D images. Since convolutional networks have achieved widespread success for imaging applications including medical imaging, they are being utilized in this work. Initially, convolutional networks were trained to predict the center pixel of patches sampled from the image. More recently, the more efficient convolutional encoder-decoder networks that are able to generate a prediction for every pixel in an image have been utilized.</p>
							<h3>Image Clustering and Search by Image</h3>
							<p>NASA has a rich history and NASA Langley's Media Solutions Branch has played an integral role by documenting that history through photography. Researchers frequently submit requests for these photographs for inclusion in papers and technical reports. Unfortunately, most of the photographs are untagged and to fulfill these requests the catalog of photographs must be manually searched.</p>
							<p>I am working on two approaches to aid in searching through the catalog of of photographs. First, I am implementing a search by image system that will allow for users to find images that are visually similar to a source image they submit. Second, I am clustering the images into groups so that when a user finds a relevant image they can rapidly all other images that have been grouped with that image. The pipeline that is being used for both the image search system and clustering involves forwarding the images through a pretrained version of GoogLeNet, using the last pooling layer as a feature vector to represent each image. Then, the dimensionality of the feature vector is reduced using either PCA or t-SNE. Finally, nearest-neighbor search or clustering is performed on the reduced vectors.
