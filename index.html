							<p>I work on machine learning applications and research at NASA Langley Research Center. At NASA, I have had the unique opportunity to collaborate with many brilliant engineers and scientists to solve a variety of scientific and engineering problems with machine learning. You can find summaries of some of this work in the <a href="#projects">projects</a> section below.</p>

					<h2>Research Interests</h2>
					<p>Working at NASA has led me to become interested in applications of machine learning for science and engineering problems. I believe that when solving these problems, you should use the best tool for the job. As it turns out, deep learning is often the best tool for many of these problems, which frequently involve analyzing images or modeling complex, non-linear phenomenon. The caveat, however, is that ground truth does not often naturaly emerge for scientific and engineering problems. Further, manually labeling data requires can be cost prohibitive. Therefore, partly out of necessity, I am interested in ways to make the most of limited labeled data, such as transfer learning, and in methods for regularization.</p>

							<h2>Projects @ NASA</h2>
							<h3>Automated Analysis of Nondestructive Evaluation Data</h3>
							<p>Nondestructive evaluations (NDE) involves using methods to investigate the internal properties of materials without causing changes to the material. For example, just as a doctor can use x-ray to determine if a patient has a broken bone, engineers can use methods such as x-ray computed tomography to determine if materials such as carbon fiber have internal defects. Analyazing the data generated by these methods can be tedious and requires significant expertise. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop methods that are able to automate some of this analysis process.</p>
							<p>So far, this work has foused specifically on the problem of segmentating defects known as delaminations from carbon fiber CT data. CT data is often best visualized as stacks of 2D images. Since convolutional networks have achieved widespread success for imaging applications including medical imaging, they are being utilized in this work. Initially, convolutional networks were trained to predict the center pixel of patches sampled from the image. More recently, the more efficient convolutional encoder-decoder networks that are able to generate a prediction for every pixel in an image have been utilized.</p>
							<p>Initial work that utilized the patch based approach was presented and published at the 42nd Annual Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation. Links to the poster and paper can be found in the <a href="#publications">publications</a> section below. Check back later for more information on the encoder-decoder approach.

							<h3>Search by Image and Image Clustering</h3>
							<p>NASA has a rich history and NASA Langley's Media Solutions Branch has played an integral role by documenting that history through photography. Researchers frequently submit requests for these photographs for inclusion in papers and technical reports. Unfortunately, most of the photographs are untagged and to fulfill these requests the catalog of photographs must be manually searched.</p>
							<p>Two approaches have been developed to aid in searching through the catalog of photographs. First, a search by image system has been implemented that will allow users to find images that are visually similar to a source image they submit. Second, clustering has been utilized to place images in groups that can be tagged for future classification and retrieval. The pipeline for both search by image and clustering involves forwarding the images through a pretrained version of GoogLeNet and using the last pooling layer as a feature vector to represent each image. Then, the dimensionality of the feature vector is reduced using either PCA or t-SNE. Finally, nearest-neighbor search or clustering is performed on the reduced vectors.</p>
							<p>Check back in the future for a technical report describing this work.

									<h3>Cloud Model Parameterization</h3><p>This work is still in its early stages. Check back later for updates.</p>
